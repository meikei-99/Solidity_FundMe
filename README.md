# Hardhat Fund Me

## Leaning smart contract whereby account users can fund and withdraw ETH ðŸ“Š

### Here are some features of this smart contract:

- allows user to fund the smart contract with minimum amount of 50 USD
- allows user to fully withdraw their fund, leaving the smart contract with balance of zero
- ensures that only those who fund the smart contract can withdraw ETH
